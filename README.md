# EGIS Coding Challenge :: Food Trucks
================================================

An web application that uses [DataSF](http://www.datasf.org/) service to tell users what types of food trucks might be found near a specific location on a San Francisco Map.

#### The Application is hosted on : https://achavanga-foodtruck.herokuapp.com/

#### The Repository is Hosted on : https://github.com/achavanga/FoodTruck_Challenge/

This application supports the [Getting Started with Java on Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-java) article - check it out.

## Running Locally

Make sure you have Java and Maven installed.  Also, install the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/).

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/heroku/java-getting-started.git
$ cd java-getting-started
$ mvn install
$ heroku local:start
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).

If you're going to use a database, ensure you have a local `.env` file that reads something like this:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost:5432/java_database_name
```

## Deploying to Heroku

```sh
$ heroku create
$ git push heroku master
$ heroku open
```
